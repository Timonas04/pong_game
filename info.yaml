  how_it_works: |
      Explain how your project works
      The game uses a up/down counter for x/y for each player plus the ball. Button inputs are stored in input register, so bouncing should not be an issue.
      Game clock is input_clk divided by 4. Rest pin (active low) should be pulsed low at every start up to clear all the clock registers. If this is not done,
      the multiple internal clock divider flip flops might start out wrong, and that could mess up other functions. The ball gets updated with every game_clk pulse, while the padles are updated
      by another clock, the same frequancy as the game clock, but with a phase delay equivalent to one half period of the input_clk. This is done so that the ball doest jump past the padles,
      as could happen if both the padles and the ball were updated simultanuosly.

      Since the led matrix can only light 1 collum or 1 row at any one time, the 3 objects to be lit(padle1, padle2, and the ball) have to be lit for a period of time before the next object is lit.
      this is achieved by the inner multiplexer which is driven byt a mod 3 counter which is driven byt the multiplexer clock. The chip outputs are the outputs of this multiplexer (some logic is done after 
      the multiplexer but it is irrelevant). The x pixels (horizontal axis) is not decoded internally, and thus have to be decoded externally. They are connected as horz0 to horz4 pins. 
      Even though there are 5 bits, the led display is only 24leds wide, so only a 5 to 24 decodes is necesary. The y pixels are decoded internaly since they need some processing done on them because
      they have to light multiple leds if a padle is to be lit contra one led for the ball. Thats why the y pixels get decoded and placed in a piso shift register which is controlled by D0 and D1.
      Shifting out these bits needs to be carefully timed with the multiplexer clock since the mux_clk is the one who decites which outputs (padle1, padle2, or ball) are in the shift register in the first place. 
      Muxes for horixzontal pins and vertical pins are driven byt he same celect lines, so both x and y bits represent the same object at anny given time.

      player1 and player 2 points pins are meant to go into a decade cointer driveing a 7 segment display. If a pause is wanted after a point os scored, these two can be monitored and the clk_in can be stoped 
      to pause the game. The position registers are reset internally, so its not necessary to reset the whole chip at every point score.

      maybe important not:
      pixel[0,0] is in the bootm left corner
      
      

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Explain how to test your project
      easiest way to test some functionality would be to hook up left right buttons for player 1, set the mux_clk low, and a clk on the clock line. As long as the board has been reset and the mux clk has not
      been active after that, the outputs will be of padle1. Then the horz0 to horz4 bits can be monitored. They should be still if no button has been presed, count up when the right button is pressed, 
      and count down when teh left button is pressed. Have in mind that padle1 x coord will reset to 0 if the ball goes out of the screen, so periodic resets to 0 should be expected.

      for full functionality the chip will need 16 bit sipo shift register, 5 to 24 decoder, 16*24 led matrix, 8 input buttons, bcd counters + 7 segment displays to display points.


# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:  
    player1_up button
    player1_down button
    player1_left button
    player1_right button
    
    player2_up button
    player2_down button
    player2_left button
    player2_right button
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    out0 = horz0 (lsd)
    out1 = horz1 binary encoded position in the x direction
    out2 = horz2
    out3 = horz3
    out4 = horz4
    out5 = points player1 pulses when player 1 gets a point
    out6 = points player2
    out7 = vertical pixels shift register out 

# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    D0 = enable vertical pixels shift register
    (when D0 low, shift register ff mirror vertical pixels,
    when D0 high, then the shifting can start)
    D1 = vertical pixels shift register clock
    D2 = not used, pulled low internally
    D3 = not used, pulled low internally
    D4 = multiplexer clock - multiplexes between padle1, padle2, and ball, as the led matrix can only display one at a time
    D5 = not used, pulled low internally
    D6 = not used, pulled low internally
    D7 = not used, pulled low internally
    D5 = not used, pulled low internally
